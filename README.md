This project was implemented within the scope of the Probability Theory & Mathematical Statistics course. The aim was to perform descriptive statistics on the dataset of our choosing.

Some of the stages included:

Data cleaning, Computing and visualizing measures of central tendency and variability, determining distribution shape and kurtosis, removal of outliers, computing and analyzing correlation matrix, heat maps, creating linear, multilinear and support vector regression models, testing their performance, determining confidence intervals, performing residual analysis using multiple metrics (MAPE, RMSE, MAE, etc.)


All the code is written in R. in Jupiter notebooks environment, a PDF version is also included.
